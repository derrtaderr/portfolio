    <h2 class="now">Life:</h2>
    <p>As always, all my attention goes to my son 5 days a week(the other two days he's with his mom). We do whatever he feels like doing. Right now that is learning to swim, having nerf wars, playing video games and making videos for <a href="/saxalocity" target="_blank">Saxalocity.</a> I also make up math lessons and have him write book reports once a week to prepare for the 2nd grade.</p>
    <p> When it's about me, I like to work out using the <a href="https://www.strongfirst.com/achieve/sinister/" target="_blank">Simple and Sinster</a> method from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Tsatsouline" target="_blank">Pavel Tsatsouline.</a> I also enjoy surfing <a href="https://www.surfline.com/surf-report/hb-pier-northside/5842041f4e65fad6a7708827" target="_blank"> Huntington Beach </a> early Saturday mornings and playing God of War 4.  </p>
